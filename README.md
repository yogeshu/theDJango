How To Build a Modern Web Application to Manage Customer InformationPeople use different types of devices to connect to the internet and browse the Web. Because of this, applications need to be accessible from a variety of locations. For traditional websites, having a responsive UI is usually enough, but more complex applications often require the use of other techniques and architectures. These include having separate REST back-end and front-end applications that can be implemented as client-side web applications, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), or native mobile apps.

Some tools that you can use when building more complex applications include:

React, a JavaScript framework that allows developers to build web and native frontends for their REST API backends.
Django, a free and open-source Python web framework that follows the model view controller (MVC) software architectural pattern.
Django REST framework, a powerful and flexible toolkit for building REST APIs in Django.
In this tutorial, you will build a modern web application with a separate REST API backend and frontend using React, Django, and the Django REST Framework. By using React with Django, you'll be able to benefit from the latest advancements in JavaScript and front-end development. Instead of building a Django application that uses a built-in template engine, you will use React as a UI library, taking advantage of its virtual Document Object Model (DOM), declarative approach, and components that quickly render changes in data.

The web application you will build stores records about customers in a database, and you can use it as a starting point for a CRM application. When you are finished you'll be able to create, read, update, and delete records using a React interface styled with Bootstrap 4.
